'''
The whole idea behind the data structure is to  organize and manage the data 
so we can get an efficient access and modification to it

so there is some ways to deal with ds?
yes for instance 
we can use an array method to get access because it works very well with it
but it bad for insertion or deletion so we are gonna 
use the liked list to insert or delete 
and also both of them are not efficient when it comes to to search in item in list
so we are gonna use the search binary to find an item
